# What is data trading?
It is pretty simple, really. You‚Äôre agreeing to trade specific types of data with us **in exchange for** the offered compensation.

It's **100% optional**. Declining to participate will not negatively impact your current experience.

The types of data are specified on the offer screen, and no other data than the explicitly stated data is traded as part of the program.

Each _‚Äútrade‚Äù_ is legally binding and takes the form of a data license. By trading the data, you agree to let us license your data for the explicitly stated reasons found on the offer screen.

<br />

# What is a data license/data licensing?

A data license is a legally binding, immutable contract that contains the exact details and parameters of the trade. This includes the type of data being traded, the purposes for which the business can access and use the data, and the duration for which it can be used.

Once created, the license cannot be altered in any way; however, as a user, **you can always change your mind**. If you no longer want the business to use and/or access the data, your settings can be toggled off/on any time and the previous license becomes null and void.

If you choose to participate again, a separate, new license is created replacing the previous license.

<br />

# Why should I trade/license my data?

There are many reasons one may want to trade/license data, including receiving compensation in the form of:
- discounts
- loyalty points
- access to exclusive features
- and more.

You may also want to receive more accurate advertisements or more personalization and customization from the chosen business.

Other reasons **include contributing** to academic studies and assisting in improving products and services.

The **choice is completely up to you**; if the offer isn‚Äôt to your liking, simply decline and access/use is turned off. You can always change your mind later.

The most important thing is understanding how your data is being accessed/used and receiving fair compensation for it; finally ü•≥.
