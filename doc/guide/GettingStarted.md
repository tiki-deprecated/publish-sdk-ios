### Installation

TIKI SDK iOS comes in two versions - Development and Release - [due to the way Swift Package Manager works with binary libraries](https://blog.mytiki.com/p/distributing-ios-libraries-as-swift).

The Development version is intended for use during the development process, when you're running your app in a simulator or on a physical device attached to Xcode. This version is available in the latest stable version on the [main](https://github.com/tiki/tiki-sdk-ios) branch.

On the other hand, the Release version is designed for distribution and should be used when compiling your app for the App Store or ad hoc distribution. This version can be found in the [latest release](https://github.com/tiki/tiki-sdk-ios/releases). 

After choosgin your version, add the Swift Package repository. If you're unfamiliar, checkout Apple's [instructions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding-package-dependencies-to-your-app).

### Usage

#### 1. [Sign up](https://console.mytiki.com) (free) for a TIKI developer account to get an API ID.

#### 2. Initialize the [TIKI SDK](tiki-sdk-ios-tiki-sdk)

_Note: async —must be called from an async function or [Task](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/task)_

Configuration parameters:

- **origin &#8594; String**  
  Included in the on-chain transaction to denote the application of origination (can be overridden in individual requests). It should follow a reversed FQDN syntax. _i.e. com.mycompany.myproduct_
  
- **publishingId &#8594; String**   
  A unique identifier for your account. Create, revoke, and cycle Ids _(not a secret but try and treat it with care)_ at https://mytiki.com.

- **address &#8594; String? = nil**  
  Set the user address (primarily for restoring the state on launch). If not set, a new key pair and address will be generated for the user.


Example:

```
Task {
  let tiki = try await TikiSdk(
    origin: "com.mycompany.myproduct",
    publishingId: "565b3268-cdc0-4e5c-94c8-5d8f53d4577c"
    )
}
```

#### 3. Assign ownership
Data ownership can be assigned to any data point, pool, or stream, creating an immutable, on-chain record.

Named Parameters:
- **source &#8594; String**  
  An identifier in your system corresponding to the raw data. _i.e. a user_id_


- **type &#8594; [TikiSdkDataTypeEnum](tiki-sdk-ios-tiki-sdk-data-type-enum)**  
  `"data_point"`, `"data_pool"`, or `"data_stream"`


- **contains &#8594; Array&lt;String>**  
  A list of metadata tags describing the represented data


- **about &#8594; String? = nil**  
  An optional description to provide additional context to the transaction. Most typically as human-readable text.


- **origin &#8594; String? = nil**  
  An optional override of the default origin set during initialization

Returns:

- **String**  
  The unique transaction id (use to recall the transaction record at any time)


Example:

```
Task {
  ...
  let oid = try await tiki.assignOwnership(
    source: "12345", 
    type: TikiSdkDataTypeEnum.point, 
    contains: ["email_address"])
}
```

#### 4. Modify consent
Consent is given (or revoked) for data ownership records. Consent defines "who" the data owner has given utilization rights.

Named Parameters:
- **ownershipId &#8594; String**  
The transaction id for the ownership grant


- **destination &#8594; [TikiSdkDestination](tiki-sdk-ios-tiki-sdk-destination)**  
A collection of paths and application use cases that consent has been granted (or revoked) for.

  
- **about &#8594; String? = nil**  
An optional description to provide additional context to the transaction. Most typically as human-readable text.


- **reward &#8594; String? = nil**  
An optional definition of a reward promised to the user in exchange for consent.


- **expiry &#8594; Date ? = nil**  
  The date upon which the consent is no longer valid. If not set, consent is perpetual.

Returns:

- **[TikiSdkConsent](tiki-sdk-ios-tiki-sdk-consent)**  
  the modified `TikiSdkConsent`

Example:
```
Task {
  ...
  let consent = try await tiki.modifyConsent(
    ownershipId: oid, 
    destination: TikiSdkDestination(["*"], ["*"]));
}
```

#### 5. Apply consent
Apply consent to a data transaction. If consent is granted for the `source` and `destination` and has not expired, the request is executed.

Parameters:
- **source &#8594; String**  
An identifier in your system corresponding to the raw data.  
_i.e. a user_id_


- **destination &#8594; [TikiSdkDestination](tiki-sdk-ios-tiki-sdk-destination)**  
The destination(s) and use case(s) for the request.


- **request &#8594; ((String?) &#8594; Void)**  
The function to execute if consent granted


- **onBlocked &#8594; ((String?) &#8594; Void)**  
The function to execute if consent is denied.


- **origin &#8594; String? = null**  
  An optional override of the default origin set during initialization


Example:
```
Task {
  ...
  try await applyConsent(source: "12345", destination: TikiSdkDestination(["*"], ["*"]), request: {
    print("Consent Approved. Send data to backend.")
  });
}
```
